# radioSTAR
**_Radio Statistical Tracking and Automated Review_** is an accountability program for radio stations and their DJs.  radioStar is a web application that builds profiles for each DJ at a specific Radio Station, giving them a compliance rating, artist metrics, listener counts, and general feedback about the status of their show. When a DJ is out of compliance, it will affect their compliance rating and an e-mail will be automatically sent to the appropriate manager(s) at a station to notify them of the compliance breach. We will be creating AI to do all of these actions efficiently in real time.


Currently, radioSTAR is being developed to work with KCSC Radio at CSU, Chico. Plans beyond that will be announced at a later time.
